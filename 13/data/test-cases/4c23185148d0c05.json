Cypress tried to locate elements based on this query:\n\n> cy.get(button#nextButtonfalse, [object Object])\n\nWe initially found matching element(s), but while waiting for them to become actionable, they disappeared from the page. Common situations why this happens:\n  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously\n  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element\n\nYou can typically solve this by breaking up a chain. For example, rewrite:\n\n> `cy.get('button').click().click()`\n\nto\n\n> `cy.get('button').as('btn').click()`\n> `cy.get('@btn').click()`\n\nhttps://on.cypress.io/element-has-detached-from-dom","time":{"start":1721494633271,"stop":1721494703564,"duration":70293}}]},"tags":[]},"source":"4c23185148d0c05.json","parameterValues":[]}
